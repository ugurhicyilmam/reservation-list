# Q Ch Project

This is a demo application created for Quandoo. It includes a table to show list of reservations with additional functionalities to filter, search and order the list.

The project has no API. Instead data accessed from a JSON file in assets folder. However, accessing the data still handled by an HTTP request to reflect the real use-case.

The application built using Angular. The only additional dependency is lodash.

No CSS framework used for design. SCSS is used and BEM methodology is applied to structure CSS.

To run the application, run `npm install` and `npm start` in application folder.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.
